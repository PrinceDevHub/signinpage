# Sliding Login & Signup Page

A simple and responsive Sliding Login & Signup Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This form allows users to switch between login and registration (signup) with a smooth sliding transition effect.

🚀 Features

- Clean and modern UI
- Sliding animation between login and signup forms
- Responsive layout (can be adapted for mobile)
- Easy to integrate into any website or project

 🔧 How It Works

- The page includes two main form sections: one for login, one for signup.
- A set of buttons lets the user switch between the forms.
- JavaScript handles the sliding animation by updating CSS transform properties.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the form.
3. Modify the styles in `style.css` or logic in `script.js` to fit your needs.

 📦 Dependencies

✍️ Customization Tips

- Update `style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- Add form validation or connect to a backend (like Firebase, Node.js, etc.) as needed.
- Make the form mobile-friendly with media queries.
